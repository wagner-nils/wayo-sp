Acting as both a project management and a controlling tool, wayo. aims to simplify and enhance business processes, providing an efficient platform for managing a company's day-to-day activities.

### Key Features:

### Advanced Capabilities (Future Implementations):

Invoice Generation and Management:
In future updates, wayo. will offer automated invoice creation, simplifying the billing process. Users will be able to manage invoices directly within the tool, ensuring they can easily keep track of payments and account receivables.

Integration and Analysis:
Additional capabilities will include market, location, and competition analysis tools, further supporting strategic business decisions. The integration with email and document management systems like SharePoint, and the checking for required documents, will streamline administrative workflows. HubSpot integration will also be considered for enhancing customer relationship management.
